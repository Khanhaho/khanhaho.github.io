A new phone-based phishing scam that spoof Appe Inc. is likely to fool quite a few people, even an experience one.

An automated call is first made to the phone, which somehow displayed as coming from Apple itself. This was probably made possible if the user has Apple contact default setup on their phone. Once the user call back to the number in the message, the whole process would be setup like an legitimate Apple care line which will then try to exploit the user of their credentials.

The only way to ensure you are not phished is to go directly to Apple website and call the number listed in there. When you are doing that, make sure that is indeed the real Apple site, as scammers have been known to polute the web so the search engine would display their spoof site first in the search.
