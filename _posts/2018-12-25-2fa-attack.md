Attackers created a phishing campaign targeting Yahoo and Gmail user who use 2FA (two factors authentication) using either a SMS sent to the phone or OTP generated by an authenticator app.

This sophisticated attack trick people into giving the attackers all their login info for Yahoo and Gmail, and once the attackers get access to the victims account, they will set up a third-party app password to maintain continued access to the account, even if the victims change their account password.

### So it seems 2FA is also flawed, what can I do?

Well, the best way is to employ U2F (Univeral 2nd Factor). You will need to purchase a device and use it together with your PC or phone everytime you want to log in a service.
